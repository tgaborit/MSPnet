# EE579-IFTT

This project consists in the implementation of a **if this then that** functionality. Devices based on a MSP430 microcontroller are able to send inputs and receive outputs to any similar device connected to the system based on a web-based server. The logic defining the inputs and outputs is configurable by the user.
